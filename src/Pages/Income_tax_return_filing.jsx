<p><b>Bank Statements</b></p>

<p><b>Investment and Capital Gain Documents</b></p>
<p>If you‚Äôve invested in mutual funds, stocks, or fixed deposits, gather documents like dividend statements, capital gains reports, and interest certificates. For instance, dividends exceeding ‚Çπ10 lakh must be reported in your ITR.</p>
<p><b>Proof of Other Income</b></p>
<p>Include documentation for income beyond salary‚Äîsuch as freelance payments, rental earnings, or bonuses. This may involve rent agreements, freelance invoices, or interest income certificates.</p>
