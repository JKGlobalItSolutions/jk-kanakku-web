<h3 style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>STEP 1: Choose the Name of Trust</h3>
<p>The initial step is to choose a suitable name for the trust, ensuring it does not violate the Trade Marks Act, 1999, or any other applicable laws, and fully complies with the provisions of the Emblems and Names (Prevention of Improper Use) Act, 1950</p>

<h3 style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>STEP 2: Draft MOA and Trust Deed</h3>
<p>The Memorandum of Association (MoA) outlines the relationship between the trustees and the trust, and clearly states the objectives for which the trust is established. It must include the names, addresses, occupations, and signatures of all members. Alongside the MoA, the trust deed serves as the primary legal document that sets forth the rules and regulations governing the trust. It details the duties and responsibilities of the trustees, as well as the procedures for delivering benefits to the beneficiaries</p>

<h3 style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>STEP 3 Register the Trust Deed</h3>
<p>Trust Deed</p>
<p>Identity and Address Proofs of the Settlor and Trustees</p>
<p>Passport-sized Photographs of the Settlor and Trustees</p>
<p>Proof of Registered Office Address of the Trust</p>


<h3 style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>STEP 4: Obtain the Trust Registration Certificate</h3>
<p>Upon successful review and verification of the submitted documents, and once the registrar is satisfied with their authenticity and legal compliance, the trust will be officially registered. A Trust Registration Certificate will then be issued by the registrar</p>

<h3 style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>STEP 5: Obtain PAN and TAN for the Trust</h3>
<p>Apply online for a Permanent Account Number (PAN) and a Tax Deduction and Collection Account Number (TAN) for the trust through the Income Tax Department’s official portal</p>
