<p><span style={{ color: "#8f5d13", fontWeight: "600" }}>The registration process to apply for 80G registration and 12A registration is mentioned below</span></p>
<h3 style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>Registration under Section 12A:</h3>
<p>As per Rule 17A of the Income Tax Act, 1962, an application for registration under Section 12A must be made using Form 10A and submitted to the Jurisdictional Commissioner of Income Tax (Exemptions).</p>
<p>Upon receiving the application along with the necessary supporting documents, the Commissioner will examine the organization’s eligibility. If satisfied with the details provided, the Commissioner will issue an order granting the 12A registration certificate. However, if additional information or clarification is required, the Commissioner may request further documents or evidence. In the case of dissatisfaction, the applicant will be given an opportunity to be heard before the application is rejected.</p>
<p>It is important to note that 12A registration may be revoked at any time if there is credible evidence that:</p>
<p>The organization engages in unlawful activities</p>
<p>Its operations deviate from its stated charitable or religious objectives</p>
<p>It promotes the interests of a particular caste or religion (unless permitted by law)</p>
<p>It misuses funds for unlawful purposes</p>
<p>It uses its income or assets for the private benefit of individuals associated with the organization</p>

<h3 style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>Registration Under Section 80G:</h3>
<p>Apply to the Internal Revenue Service Commissioner under the organisation's authority for Section 80G registration. After you apply for Section 80G registration, the Income Tax Department will thoroughly review all the documentation you provided.</p>
<p>The authorities will request further documents if they want more information. The documentation must be turned in by the deadline.</p>
<p>The award of an 80G registration follows. If the department is happy with verifying the information and documents presented, the Commissioner will award the firm an 80G Certification. </p>

<p><b>12a enlistment online:</b> To renew or register on the Income Tax Portal, the applicant—a society or other institution—needs to use Form No. 10A (or 10 AB, depending on the situation) online by the above-mentioned due dates. The candidate will be approached to present the materials shown below with their application. </p>
<p><b>12a declaration online:</b> If Advanced Signature documents the arrival of pay, the association's approved signatory should check the application upon accommodation. Suppose it isn't recorded through Advanced Signature, the document the application through EVC. </p>
<p><b>Online income tax 12A registration:</b> The PCIT or CIT, as approved by the Board, will support or reject an application submitted in Structure No 10A (or 10 Stomach muscle, by and large). If the application is supported, the PCIT or CIT will give a 16-digit alphanumeric URN.</p>
<p>Between April 1, 2021, and June 30, 2021, all licensed NGOs subject to sections 12A, 12AA, and 80G must submit a renewal application for their registrations under sections 80g and 12a with the Income Tax Department.</p>
<p>It is a solitary structure for the two sorts of enlistments, Segment 12AB and Area 80G Enrolments, and Structure 10A's internet-based accommodation for applying for 80G Enrolment has been dispensed with.</p>
<p>Because of the alteration, consent and another enrolment testament or recharging endorsement will be given for quite some time. All petitions are forthcoming before the Important Chief or Magistrate under the old guidelines, and for which no structure has been provided by April 1, 2021, should be resubmitted on Structure 10A. In this way, these are the revalidation changes for recharging 80g and 12a enlistments.</p>
